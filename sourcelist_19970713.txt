  "Good evening. This is the 37th time I've spoken to you from this office
   where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this
   nation. Each time I've done so to discuss with you some matters that I
   believed affected the national interest. In all the decisions I've made in
   my public life, I've always tried to do what was best for the nation. As
   long as there was such a base, I've felt strongly that it was nessesary to
   see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do
   otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult
   process. But with the disappearance and the dangerously destabilizing
   precedent for the future, I've concluded that because of the Watergate
   matter, I might not have the support of the congress, that I'd consider
   nessesary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of
   this office in the way the interest of the nation would require."

  "They fought the longest war in American history."
  "In 1965 Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war, but it wasn't. It was
   different in many ways, and so were those who did the fighting. In World 
   War II the average age of the combat soldier was 26. In Vietnam he was 19."
  "19"
  "The heaviest fighting of the past two weeks continued today 25 miles 
   northwest of Saigon."
  "I wasn't really sure what was going on."
  "In Vietnam the combat soldier typicaly served a twelve month tour of duty 
   but was exposed to hostile fire almost every day."
  "In Saigon a US military spokesman said today more than 700 enemy troops were
   killed last week in that sensitive border area. Throughout all of South-
   Vietnam the enemy lost a total of 2689 soldiers."
  "You're 18 years old and you're wearing somebody's brains around on your 
   shirt because they got their heads blown off right next to you ... and 
   that's not supposed to affect you ... I can never understand. What would 
   scare me, is if we were to send a group of 18-year olds 1200 miles away, 
   and subject them to a year of that insanity, and have them not be affected.
   That's what would frighten me."
  "According to a Veteran's Administration study, half of the Vietnam combat 
   veterans suffer from what psychiatrists call post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Many vets complain of alienation, rage or guilt. Some succumb to suicidal

   to answer. I started sliding down. I could feel the water. It started to 
   come into my chin and into my nose. And when I woke up, my body was all 
   greasy from the holy oil she used to put on my body. I remember being 
   disappointed I survived. When I was five, my father took me to a friend of 
   his, and for no reason at all I hit him right in the stomach. with all my
